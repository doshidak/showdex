Thanks for your help in making Showdex better for everyone!

I'm not a stickler for how these should be formatted; just make sure you provide enough info for me to work off of. If you're having trouble running Showdex, please make sure you first try **turning off your other extensions** before opening an issue. This will help me narrow down the problem (e.g., your ad-blocker, productivity enforcer &/or distraction minimizer could potentially block Showdex from downloading sets!).

If possible, including the following would be **immensely** helpful!

* **Device** (e.g., Custom PC, MacBook Pro 14" 2023, eMachines eTower 400i, Samsung Smart Fridge, etc.)
* **OS** & **Version** (e.g., Windows 11, macOS Sonoma 14.1, Ubuntu 22.04.3 LTS, Android 12, etc.)
* **Browser** (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Netscape Navigator, etc.)
* **Showdex Version** (e.g., v1.2.3)
* **Format**, if applicable (e.g., Gen 9 VGC 2024 Reg F Bo3)

If you would like to be [credited for your contribution](../README.md#contributors), please also include your username on [**Smogon Forums**](https://smogon.com/forums) or [**Pokémon Showdown**](https://pokemonshowdown.com). Otherwise, your **GitHub** username will be used, unless you don't want to be credited.

## PRs

**Fixed a bug? · Added something cool? · [A translation, perchance?](../src/assets/i18n)**

[![Commitizen friendly](https://img.shields.io/badge/commitizen-friendly-brightgreen.svg)](http://commitizen.github.io/cz-cli)

Not a stickler with these either, but at the very least, please:

* **Fork** this repo & **commit** changes to your fork,
* **Style** your code according to the [**ESLint rules**](../.eslintrc.json),
* **Create** a PR from your fork to this repo, and
* **Provide** a brief description of your changes in your PR.

Although this project makes use of [**Commitizen**](http://commitizen.github.io/cz-cli), you don't need to format your commit messages this way. Use whatever you're comfortable with!

Additionally, I don't make use of any fancy automations like CI (Continuous Integration), so each PR will be manually reviewed. Your patience is greatly appreciated!
